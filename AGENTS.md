# Working on OMXTerm

OMXTerm is an open-source desktop terminal for ARM64 macOS, Linux, and Windows, built with Electron, TypeScript, a portable DOM + Restty Terminal Surface (Ghostty WASM core), and a local `node-pty` Adapter.

## Quick commands

```sh
npm ci                       # Install locked dependencies and prepare native runtimes
npm run dev                  # Build and launch OMXTerm in development
npm test -- test/unit        # Run headless unit tests
npm run check:portable       # Format check, lint, typecheck, default tests, and build
npm run format:check         # Check formatting with Prettier
```

> **Note:** Graphical integration tests included in `npm test` and `npm run check:portable` open and focus real Electron windows. Run one graphical suite at a time on an unlocked, idle desktop. Use `npm test -- test/unit` for fast headless feedback.

## Architecture and repository layout

- `src/main/` — Electron main process: native windows, local PTY sessions, configuration and theme loading, font validation, clipboard, external link validation, bounded local-image reads, and operational logging.
- `src/preload/` — Minimal typed preload bridge with sender and payload validation.
- `src/renderer/` — Window host, tabs, chrome, snippets sidebar, and local image preview overlay (runs with context isolation enabled and Node integration disabled).
- `src/terminal-surface/` — Framework-independent DOM Terminal Surface powered by Restty and Ghostty WASM. Receives a session Adapter rather than importing Electron or `node-pty`.
- `docs/` — User guides and developer references (see [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)).

## Repository standards

- Write code, documentation, commit messages, and GitHub issues/PRs in English.
- Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, engineering standards, verification, and PR workflow, and [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md) for platform prerequisites and native test suites.
- Consult [`docs/spec.md`](docs/spec.md), [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md), and [`docs/adr/README.md`](docs/adr/README.md) when changing observable behavior or architecture. Update affected user guides and technical contracts in the same commit as behavior changes.
- Keep privileged capabilities in Electron `main`, validate external inputs at IPC and PTY boundaries, pass untrusted values as literal arguments (never interpolated shell strings), and keep terminal contents, commands, clipboard data, and private paths out of logs and commits.
- Leave version bumps, release tagging, and package publication to the maintainer release workflow in [`docs/release.md`](docs/release.md). Tracker conventions and triage labels are documented in [`docs/agents/`](docs/agents/issue-tracker.md).
